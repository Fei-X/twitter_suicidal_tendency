This is an applied machine learning project for detecting suicidality in twitter.

### Data

There are 5 data files under data/  
All of them are tweets containing keywords 'suicidal' from twitter.com.  
We collected the data along with user profile.  
All of them are hand-labeled with suicidal tendency.  

### Coding
The data_collection.ipynb file does the initial data crawling from twitter.com using twint.  
The preprocessing.ipynb file transforms the data into machine-learning-friendly mode.
