so it's a mix of both the act of transitioning and receiving support that affects the chances of suicide or suicidal attempts.

"you did. you didn't discuss jack shit, you made someone feel small and insignificant for pointing out that if someone is suicidal guilting them is wrong and ineffective. you chatted some random shit on this thread lady."
wouldn't it be lovely if this conversation actually was the last straw for someone who was actively suicidal? all this time spent making them feel unimportant and nasty for feelings they can't help and can't make better. whilst you could have been supporting suicide prevention.
"also to clarify, i went back to the beginning of this thread and used that in reference to my reply where you did indeed approve of manipulative guilting of suicidal individuals, because of 'those left behind'"
yet you condone manipulative guilting of vulnerable suicidal mentally ill individuals. looking back at the beginning of the thread and what's been said. how about you educate yourself using websites like mind etc and learn how to best support someone who is suicidal.
even if that's not your view. that's fine. but having experience with suicide personally changes your opinion. i have both been suicidal and grieved for people close to me i have lost to suicide. this isn't something we discuss lightly.
"wow lay on the guilt as thick as you can hey. nobody said that, but usually the suffering and reasoning an individual goes through that leads to suicide often takes a back seat and isn't considered. assuming you haven't been actively suicidal, so you wouldn't know that."

absolutely.  israel doesn't need the so called foreign aid from the usa. it's less than 5% of its budget.  with foreign aid comes pressure to make suicidal 'peace' agreements.  i detest aipac because their focus is on foreign aid and they support a '2 state solution'.

“a high percentage of the sample that was considered at risk for suicidal behaviours had knowledge of someone who had died by suicide (29.3% of the youth sample and 48.1% of the adult sample).” 16/30
"“impulsivity was also associated w/ a lack of appropriate coping mechanisms, &amp; this was quite specific to a proximal trigger (predominantly relationship breakdowns), the absence of effective coping skills &amp; the use of alcohol &amp; drugs as an enabler to suicidal behaviours.” 13/30"
"“the wasc-y also importantly includes a subscale that determines cultural resilience, an important focus in this field given that prevention often requires the ability to not only target known risk factors for suicidal behaviours” 4/30"
"“this likely reflects a lack of cultural appropriateness of mainstream mental health services. historically, research has not focused upon determining whether there is a different set of risk factors for suicidal behaviours that can be established at a population level.” 2/5"

"a conversation and more questions need to be asked before saying they're suicidal, depressed, etc. so people in their mentions diagnosing are out of line.  also - ppl need to know that suicidal ideation/thoughts, etc don't look one way. no need to demonize it at all, either way."

just be aware that the words “coward” and “selfish” are often assigned to mentally ill people that attempt or die by suicide who aren’t shitty abusers. our use of them now can have an unintentional negative impact on people actively struggling with suicidal ideation.

i’m very serious. you can commit to something (like a relationship) but people who work in mental health spaces advocate for people with suicidal ideations by removing the “commit suicide” phrase from their verbiage. does that make sense?
unrelated: people commit crimes. people do not commit suicide. suicide is not a crime and people with suicidal behaviors or attempts shouldn’t be stigmatized or equated to criminals.  try using “died by suicide” or “took their own life” instead. 👍🏾
if i hadn’t spoken to that suicidal girl in 6th grade i would’ve been ok

why would you do such a thing? (talking in a general sense) surely no undertaking is really worth death and suicidal trauma!!

i’m getting secondhand suicidal thoughts from this.
i do not like how others have used my body. i know that others have harmfully used stolen control of my body to hurt me by using the thing that they grew in my head to cause my brain to feel sad without logical reason and this is how they gave me anxiety and suicidal sadness.
my penis should not make fluid. i am being sadly raped if my penis makes fluid. i should not feel suicidal. i need to not be hurt by the strange thing that seems to grow in my penis by my eating of food; i can not see this strange thing but this thing has ruined parts of my life.
i think that there is a parasite in my penis which has diseased my penis so the penis kept making bad fluid and i need my penis to not make fluid. penis fluid causes me to feel suicidal and causes me to want to destroy my brain to end pain so my penis should not make fluid.
i do not want to feel mad. i need to not feel mad. i should not feel mad. those whom followed me caused me to feel mad and suicidal so i need this to stop. i need to not feel mad. i want to not feel suicidal.

"my penis should not be sucked. during all times, my penis should not be sucked. i want to not feel my penis. feelings of my penis cause me to be sad and suicidal. i should not have feelings of my penis. i want to not have my penis sucked. i need to not feel my penis if sucked."
i do not want sex. all sexual things are disturbing and hurtful to me and cause me to want to kill myself. i need to not have any sexual thing. i should not be around sexual things. all sexual things are bad and should not be near me. these things cause me to be sad and suicidal

"regardless of the intent associated with self-harm or suicidal behaviour, it is critical that each person, no matter what the motivational elements associated with self-harm or attempted suicide, is comforted, validated and supported with care and compassion."

the comments on this post go to show how hard it is for people to talk openly on how they experience depression without immediately regretting it. on the topic of suicidal ideation though—i think we already have a very warped idea of what suicidal ideation feels like.

they literally eavesdrop on people and make you think everything is caused by them. they knew your brother was suicidal because they were eavesdropping on him. they waited until he was gonna say or do something stupid so you could blame it on them and be further ostracized.

"it’s the way that if i was actually suicidal forreal that they wouldn’t give a fuck about how all of their apathetic responses could throw me off the edge because they’re rude and entitled, but they definitely need to spend more time expanding their vocabulary."
suicide is the act of killing yourself. suicidal thoughts/ideations are creating scenarios or having thoughts of taking your own life. i’m not dealing with any one of the above. i just don’t want to exist in this world. which is the state of not being. especially w/ you dipshits.
it’s the way all of you are psychiatrists for me. stop diagnosing me trying to tell me what’s wrong with me. y’all do not know me. the first 4 words literally say i’m not even suicidal. depression ≠ suicide. suicidal thoughts is a symptom of depression. nonexistence ≠ suicide.
being suicidal would involve actually wanting to kill yourself and i never said i wanted to kill myself. y’all brains don’t be braining which is the main reason i don’t wanna coexist with the rest of y’all 😭
also you have to be suicidal to have suicide ideations. can y’all pls just stfu?
"i’m not even suicidal. i just don’t want to exist anymore. i think ppl should normalize the feeling of not wanting to exist without trying to demonize it, or make it seem as if there’s something wrong with you for not wanting to be in a place you didn’t ask to be in."

"if someone calls for help before a suicide attempt, during an attempt, or afterwards, it doesn't mean they're ""attention-seeking"", ""manipulative"" or ""acting out"".   it doesn't mean they're not serious.  this is suicidal ambivalence - an opportunity to help which may save a life."
"the suicidal pain felt before making a suicide attempt is just as painful for the person who lives as it was for the person who dies.    if someone attempts repeatedly, it doesn't mean they get used to the pain. it hurts just as much as the first time.  all attempts are serious"

"he sent a message out saying he was gonna block someone who was feeling suicidal and he started arguing with other users. eventually he left twitter, but he’s returned.  he also criticises people’s art on devianart i believe. as well as he can’t take any criticism himself."

meh. it’s whatever. i think there’s the notion that suicidal people have a great deal of impetus to do the things required to end life but most of it is just not wanting to exist.  the “ending life” parts are like “peaks”.
i think more people need to reckon with the fact that “not wanting to exist” is what “suicidal” looks like.

i swear y’all really be invalidating people &amp; how they feel. she said she’s not suicidal &amp; i feel the same way as her. i wish i had never been born i’m afraid to die. i have anxiety about death &amp; don’t want to die therefore wishing i didn’t exist so i wouldn’t have to die....

mate i feel you. i do. but i also truly believe if klopp wanted anyone specific we’d have gone for them. klopp likes small squads. lovern was absolutely shite so replacing him with an academy lad as 4th choice isn’t exactly suicidal unless the extreme happens.

i gave up on the so called mh services long ago. whilst in ipswich in 2019 i was admitted due to suicidal plans i stupidly admitted to a gp. in her case she was both incredibly lovely and professional. she even drove me in her own vehicle to a/e with a colleague in case.

what's the answer  employment rising but watch it at furlough end. less working = less tax to collect = higher welfare bill.  makes no sense. you need help to recover and we need help now to be able to help. failure to do so will be economically suicidal.

u have 270+ on ur main and u got them all by posting fake suicidal posts saying u care even tho u tell people to kill themselves shush
true but you can’t go wishing death upon peoples parents and expect people to give a fuck about you being suicidal
that's so untrue though. there are plenty of suicidal people that only don't kill themselves because there isn't a quick and efficient way to do it. someone could also be indifferent towards existing.
everyone doesn't value existing. someone could be suicidal or indifferent towards existing. even if every person valued existing though that would only mean that every person agrees on something subjective. that subjectively agreed upon opinion wouldn't become objective then.

"if you know an unstable young person who has access to g*ns, in their home or job, ask them if they’re suicidal. straight up ask them if they want to die. are we afraid of guns or emotions that are hard to accept? these situations don’t have to turn out this way."

"if you're not making fun of someone else i dont mind. its targetted hate i dont like, aka bullying/harassment or whatever. that's like me, i use to be suicidal and now i jokingly talk about it. but that's me, not about someone else who is/has gone through it."
concerned that someone may be suicidal? ask directly. this will not give a new idea. it will start a conversation and may just save a life!
many suicidal people probably already prioritize others over themselves. this just further instills the idea that others are more worthy imo.
exactly!! it’s soul destroying! what about the individual who is suffering!? i just feel so gutted and saddened that this is someone’s view on people who are suicidal! ☹️💞
"not suicidal or shit, but sometimes i look at this world and i don't feel like participating in anything at all.😣😣"

everyone is mad at  being anti-white and coercing white employees to undergo emotional psychological and emotional abuse by those who hold power and privilege over them. i hope whites sure the fk outta them. might make ppl suicidal. might need psychiatric care. $$$

to get placed on a suicide watch. i truly think she just demonizes suicidal behavior as something she “would never have” so she refuses to accept that it’s exactly what she has lol
"i work in a psychiatric hospital but in the er part of it, and i see this behavior frequently. you don’t have to have a plan or intent to have suicidal ideations. flat out saying that you don’t want to exist because you didn’t ask to be here is definitely enough"
"sis is definitely suicidal, but she demonizes being suicidal so that’s why she doesn’t want to be labeled as such."
walk into any healthcare facility &amp; tell them that you don’t want to exist anymore because you never consented to existing &amp; they will place you under a suicide watch. you can be suicidal &amp; not have a plan to kill yourself. the only way to not exist is by what?
i doubt he knows that much about history. you can be well behaved and get all the details right but if you have the wrong axioms and a deep seated hatred of yourself and your nation you’re just going to propagate that spirit of suicidal despair

"people do get better, and to assess someone as depressed/suicidal and immediately skip to validating or assisting their suicide quite frankly does sound ghoulish. they are in pain and want to be put out of pain, yes, but a good portion come out of it without committing suicide."
"many people who experience suicidal ideation actually do get well and move on to living a very fulfilling life. of those who have attempted suicide and then got therapy afterward, they were 27% less likely to attempt again than those than attempted once and didn’t get therapy"

"the words “love” and “hate” have been. realistically, it is suicidal ideation even if at this point it’s become passive.  people need to value the heavy weight of death or simply never existing and the strain it has on the human mind to say or even think about it in any context."

you're completely wrong there. the thing that helps trans people and lowers the rate of suicidal ideation is acceptance. refusing to accept us is what is killing us.  don't even fucking start if you haven't done the most basic research.

figure it out? im happy with who i am. im educated. i get money for doing nothing. im living my best life. what are you doing? making suicidal people feel bad for something they can't control? body shaming women. calling people you dont know evil?
no everyone who suffers depression is suicidal also. not everyone who suffers depression has a hard time accepting the world as a miracle. the problem with depression is that we feel like we are not worthy of the miracle of life. reassurance that they are wanted is a need
i dont think you understand that even tho people who are depressed feel hopeless and suicidal have a hard time realizing their gifts from life. and when they do its hard to accept the fact that the world is as great as every one makes it out to be

i'm not suicidal; but just remember that it's not everybody that loves you.  even your own blood will take you out.
you’re suicidal.
i know but normalizing it normalizes that overlapped group of suicidal thoughts. it’s ok to be a nihilist but it’s a topic everyone needs to be mindful about. suicidal people don’t have a very healthy state of mind so we need to be careful about what we could be encouraging.
"glad you are grounded but also now you are the spokesperson of all the suicidal people? you speak for yourself. instead of getting all defensive and hostile, they could just try to understand people who lost people they cared for to suicide and be mindful about possible impacts."

that is the worst part. if you feel suicidal especially if your a parent you face a 24 hour lock up instead of creating a plan.   which means kids go into foster care or financial loss.
"oh no please don’t normalize ~not wanting to exist~ this is depression and altogether passive suicidal ideation. it isn’t demonized in any way either, many individuals have or have had these issues and there’s help out there"
i agree with the sentiment of this tweet except i do identify as suicidal
"yknow lately i was at my lowest point by having suicidal thoughts and start harming myself. thinking people actually gonna leave me because im sick. but no, they dont. they still stay no matter how bad my condition is, istg i love yalls, thankyou for still believing in me."
the impact of suicide on my life &amp; my experience with suicidal thoughts is the hardest subject to talk about. until therapy i didn’t tell anyone what happened.  even now it’s so sensitive i worry as i write about it.
"i already said that jhope is supposed to be one of the innocent and good ones (but he still has suicidal thoughts and depression – the black water), which is why he takes it upon himself to help v and tried to ward off the evil inside of him."
"jhope is sitting on the chair and the black water can’t fully reach him. which also could be interpreted as the dark/evil, suicidal thoughts (the water) that can’t reach him because he’s still has hope (=innocence=feathers)."
people are really saying he might have suicidal thought lol. if that's not over exaggeration then idk what is
"same here. not necessarily suicidal, but sure do wish death would hurry the fuck up sometimes."
if this minecraft roleplay was really so small you wouldn’t give a damn. it’s a storyline on modern media. if you truly believed any of this you would be cancelling tommy for portraying suicidal ideation when he hasn’t experienced it.
suicidal with a touch of ✨critical thinking✨  normalize these feelings dont resist what already exists and change the system that creates these feelings dont call me mentally ill our society is ill we are all ill

"because honestly y’all don’t know how to talk to anyone about actual real *scary* suicidal thoughts and actions, or how to support people when they are having passive ideation/just don’t want to exist so that they dont end up having active ideation and that’s an issue"
"as someone who has had both passive and active suicidal thoughts and have attempted suicide, there is a huge huge difference and we should be able to talk about all of it without being stigmatized and i want people to be able to talk about their active suicidal ideation"

"would you rather have a successful life from smoking weed, or a successful life filled with depressed and suicidal thoughts/actions that eventually lead you to take your own life?   idk about you, but definitely the weed one for me."
i’m sure you had good intentions posting this but these thoughts are called “passive suicidal thoughts” and trying to normalize them is dangerous and you shouldn’t be dismissing all the people in your replies trying to tell you this. they aren’t healthy thoughts at all.
hey real quick this is called a “passive suicidal thought” and should not be normalized.
"am i replying to you? no, u replied to my comment and my personal experience so i mean you're in it... i love how y'all assuming i'm telling ppl about their lives etc when i'm speaking in general about suicidal thoughts and feelings...🧘🏽‍♀️"
"weather it's saying “i want to sleep forever”or going through traumatic experiences, those are lead ups to most suicides,people say things like “ i wish i didn't exist”and kill themselves the next day, that's why this statement is worrisome and can be taken as a suicidal ideation"
"and i said “i understand her” my tweet wasn't trying to say “nope, she's definitely suicidal.. “ it was me replying to the chart and how therapist etc would see it...i agree with everyone under the thread saying she's not... n even shared her tweet..."
"reading is fundamental and very important... i never said she was, i was talking about if she got evaluated etc medically and psychology wise she would fall up under it, i never said from my own text “shes totally suicidal” i even said they wouldn't get that and she would have to"
"but where in my statement did i say “ she is totally suicidal” i said what she said is suicidal ideations, i said in my statement “im not saying she is”"
"that’s why saying “i wish i didn’t exist” is suicidal ideations, it’s not about you not doing it or whatever the case might be it’s strictly the point of not wanting to live...and that’s coming from yourself...your own thoughts.. it’s a ideation"
"idk if y’all know but planning and pondering on suicidal thoughts are lead ups, counting all the times someone has done something to you, knowing you want to.. is a lead up..everything leads up to something especially suicide!"
"because thats apart of suicidal thinking...before people said or thought “i want to kill myself” it led up to it, having thoughts like “i don't want to exisst” can be a suicidal ideation, tell that to a therapist or counselor they will still would write you out as suicidal..."
"thanks for letting us down, for unemployment, suicidal rates going upward, for mental health decline, latent anxiety and acc activation.   is correcting the r rate numbers to make sure that the fear monger strategy continues"

one day you get suicidal thoughts in self doubt and the next day you realise millions of people support you for who you are. that’s life! living in the moment is right but living for the moment isn’t...just keep moving.  more power to you!
are u gonna slander naomis name even more with more lies and laugh at her being depressed and suicidal again? are u gonna send ur kiddie fans to try and de-platform her? the fact u have no shame or regret about the hell u put her through just shows ur a nasty person.

it would me too. anxiety and depression suck. i’ve dealt with anxiety for a long time and used to get depressed a lot and suicidal thoughts back in my teens and 20’s. i have a friend that’s dealing with it all right now too. people think it’s ok to joke about but it’s really not.

"you're arguing that if we are against pedophiles, it's the same thing as being against suicide. that the ""logic"" means we cannot get rid of pedophiles and keep suicidal people. that's what you said.  but that's only true if we ignore that one is far more immoral than the other."
"of course, that's already ignoring the fact that not everyone who suffers from depression is suicidal, not does everyone engage in hurting themselves.  there are two many glaring differences for you to successfully make this argument."
probably because i’m having suicidal thoughts💔💔😢
yea having to be related to you has made suicidal
"like i understand wanting to be careful with how you define your state of being, but the issue comes at the latter part where they mention not wanting their feelings to be “demonized.” in that same respect, suicidal people shouldn’t be demonized either."

not one of the boys who drove me to suicidal thoughts and made me scared to attend the next two quarters of school while my rapist was stalking me will be held accountable. yet their title violation is on my transcript and my health destroyed.
"the social bullying in high school was so bad that in undergrad i tried not to make many friends, avoided extracurriculars, and ignored an invitation to an honor society.despite my efforts to not have anyone know me, strangers still drove me to suicidal thoughts with rape culture"
i’m not suicidal or anything but i wanna kms so fucking bad
it’s crazy how we talk so much about mental health and bullying on media and in school. yet some people are still so ignorant and don’t understand having  metal illnesses are what  causes “jumpers” (suicidal people) to happen. being judged after isn’t going to help any.
"the only difference abt this shit is that im not going through suicidal ideation. like i wanna be here, i really do. but i dont know what the fuck is going on anymore. i just wanna feel safe. levelled. and grounded. and protected. thats all. and i dont think thats too much."

apparently there are psychiatrists in canada who have no ethical qualms with validating disabled patients' suicidal ideation and don't see a lawsuit waiting to happen if they do this  why am i not surprised
only in   do we demand that the voices of disabled people with suicidal ideation that would get them instantly committed if they weren't disabled take priority over those of us who see that ideation as no more rational than abled people's...

nvm lol i watched ben schwartz on gmm and now i'm not suicidal anymore
this is actually a form of suicidal thoughts. it’s called passive suicidal thoughts. all part of depression but it’s interesting to think that this could lead to active suicidal thoughts or a break where it turns to action

really feel and i don't want to scare my friends and family. the truth is i am more depressed and more stressed then i have ever been and it has taken a heavy toll on my mind and wellbeing. im not proud to admit that i have had several suicidal thoughts and i know now that i am
you’re missing it or maybe just don’t understand. it’s not a “i want to die/not be here” feeling. like actual existence isn’t necessary. maybe you can’t grasp the difference? or the rest of us aren’t explaining it so cut and dry. but it’s not being suicidal.
"as someone who has attempted suicide twice, who lives with suicidal ideations, i never had anything “lead up” to it. not existing and wanting to die, are different, to me. and not everyone’s brain works the same, your experiences aren’t mine nor hers. can’t lump it all together."
"3am in the morning, school tomorrow, work due in, motivation to do anything in life? non existent.   can someone tell me when life suddenly became so meh? no reason to do anything but not meaning im suicidal or depressed.   just my motivation in life has disappeared. how?"
dazai’s character is more than just a suicidal maniac. he’s desperately trying his purpose in life and he’s an abused person who turned into an abuser.
